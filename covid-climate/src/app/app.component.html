      <h3> A look at the CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</h3>
      <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the world looked a little bit different in 2020. People stayed at home,
        travelling was often impossible and planes had to stay grounded for the most part.</p>
      <p>These factors have resulted in noticeable changes to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. But just how much difference did
        it make?</p>

      <h2>How did CO<sub>2</sub> emissions change in 2020?</h2>
      <p>The data shown here comes from Carbon Monitor <a href="#sourceBox">[1]</a>, an international platform
        providing science-based
        estimates of
        daily CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

      <h2>Influence of different sectors</h2>
      <p>You might wonder which sectors were responsible for these emissions. Take a look at the sectors here:</p>
      <div class="key">
        <h4>Top Graph</h4>
        <ul>

          <img class="dropdownArrow" src="assets/icons/dropDownArrow.svg" alt="">

      <i>Tip: The influences of the pandemic on singular sectors can be quite pronounced – try filtering for domestic
        aviation for example!</i>

      <p>This breakdown clearly shows that a whole range of sectors contribute to the amount of global emissions.</p>
      <p>
        The <span class="power">power sector</span> is primarily made up of the energy used for electricity, heat and
        transport.
        <span class="groundTransport">Ground transport</span>
        emissions result from passenger vehicles such as cars and buses, as well as from trucks transporting goods.
        The <span class="industry">industry</span> sector represents CO<sub>2</sub> emissions resulting from industrial
        processes, and the <span class="residential">residential</span>
        sector
        shows the emissions from residential structures that mainly derive from the amount of energy they consume.
        Finally, the <span class="domesticAviation">domestic aviation</span> sector summarizes the CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions caused by domestic flights in the
        selected country.</p>
      <p>
        By being aware of the impact of each sector on our total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions figure, we can better
        understand which areas
        need to - and can - be targeted, in order to effectively reduce our carbon footprint.</p>

      <h2>Historic context</h2>
      <p>We have seen that the Corona pandemic ensured that significantly less CO<sub>2</sub> was emitted worldwide.
        However, the question remains, what good it has done to our climate. In the foreseeable future, the regulations
        will be loosened, and eventually lifted altogether. But what if - as of today - we would simply continue with
        the containment measures? Could these measures also be used to help us meet our climate goals?
        We set up two prognosis lines, that give insight into just that:
      </p>

      <i>Tip: Use the slider below the graph to see a specific period!</i>
      <p>
        The y-axis depicts the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per day <a href="#sourceBox">[4]</a><a href="#sourceBox">[5]</a>, while the x-axis shows the years.
        The data for the prognosis for continuing without regulations, was calculated by the U.S. Energy Information
        Administration <a href="#sourceBox">[2]</a>.
        Based on this data, we calculated a forecast for continuing with regulations by mapping this years percentage
        decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the data from <a href="#sourceBox">[2]</a>. This of course means a
        decrease in emissions, but
        what could be the impacts on climate warming if we continued with the regulations experienced 2020 in all the
        upcoming years?

      <h2>Achieving the Climate Goals</h2>
      <p>
        According to the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC) <a
        href="#sourceBox">[3]</a> the atmosphere can
        absorb
        roughly 1042 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> from the beginning of 2021 on until the global temperature will be
        2° C more than pre industrial levels. If the warming should stay below 1.5° C, the remaining budget is roughly
        293 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>.

        The horizontal dashed line marks the total budget that cannot be exceeded without exceeding the respective goal.
        We calculated this value by adding the remaining budget from <a href="#sourceBox">[3]</a> to the historic

      </p>
