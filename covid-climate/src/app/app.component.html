      <h1> CO<sub>2</sub>-Emissions </h1>
      <h2> 2019 & 2020 </h2>
      <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the world looked a little bit different in 2020. People stayed at home,
        travelling was often impossible and planes had to stay grounded for the most part.</p>
      <p>These factors have resulted in noticeable changes to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. As can be seen in the chart
        on the right, the daily CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for 2020 look fairly different from those of last year. The data
        shown here comes from by Carbon Monitor [1], an international platform providing science-based estimates of daily CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

      <p>The unit of the y-Axis of the graph is <i>Megatons of carbon dioxide per day</i>. One Megaton equals <strong>1,000,000
        metric tons.</strong> The graph underneath gives insight into the number of Covid-19 cases, while the transparent areas illustrate the periods of
        when the selected country had a lockdown.</p>

      <h2>Difference between 2019 and 2020</h2>
      <p>Let's take a look at how the emissions changed from 2019 to 2020.</p>
      <p>The green areas mark where the emissions were lower in 2020 and red areas mark where they were higher.</p>
      <ul class="legend">
        <li class="area-below">
          <div class="bullet"></div>
          Less Emissions than 2019
        </li>
        <li class="area-above">
          <div class="bullet"></div>
          More Emissions than 2019
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thanks to this direct comparison between 2019 and 2020, positive as well as negative changes come to light.
        How do these changes correlate with the number of Covid-19 cases or the lockdown periods? </p>

      <h2>Influence of different sectors</h2>
      <p>You might wonder which sectors were responsible for these emissions. Take a look at the sectors here:</p>
      <ul class="legend">
        <li *ngFor="let sectorKey of sectorKeys.slice().reverse(); index as i" [class]="sectorKey">
          <div class="bullet"></div>
          {{sectorNames.slice().reverse()[i]}}</li>
      </ul>
      <select id="dropDownMenu" [ngModel]="selectedSector" (ngModelChange)="updateSelectedSector($event)">
        <option>All</option>
        <option *ngFor="let sector of sectorNames">{{sector}}</option>
      </select>
      <p>This breakdown clearly shows that a whole range of sectors contribute to the amount of global emissions.
        The energy sector is primarily made up of the energy used for electricity, heat and transport. Road transport
        emissions result from passenger vehicles such as cars and buses, as well as from trucks transporting goods.
        The industry sector represents CO<sub>2</sub> emissions resulting from industrial processes, and the residential sector
        shows the emissions from residential structures that mainly derive from the amount of energy they consume.
        Finally, the domestic aviation sector summarizes the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused by domestic flights in the selected country.
        By being aware of the impact of each sector on our total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions figure, we can better understand which areas
        need to - and can - be targeted, in order to effectively reduce our carbon footprint.</p>

      <h2>Achieving the climate goals</h2>
      <p>We have seen that the Corona pandemic ensured that significantly less CO<sub>2</sub> was emitted worldwide.
        However, the question remains, what good it has done to our climate. In the foreseeable future, the regulations
        will be loosened, and eventually lifted altogether. But what if - as of today - we would simply continue with
        the containment measures? Could these measures also be used to help us meet our climate goals?
        We set up two prognosis lines, that give insight into just that:
      </p>
      <ul class="legend">
        <li class="linePrognosisLockdown">
          <div class="bullet"></div>
          Continuation with regulations
        </li>
        <li class="linePrognosisNoLockdown">
          <div class="bullet"></div>
          Continuation without regulations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The y-axis depicts the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per day, while the x-axis shows the years.
        The white graph represents the global CO<sub>2</sub> of an average day from 1750 to 2020. From there, our prognosis graphs begin.
        The data for the prognosis for continuing without regulations, was calculated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration [2].
        Based on this data, we calculated a forecast for continuing with regulations by mapping this years percentage
        decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the data from [2]. This of course means a decrease in emissions, but what
        could be the impacts on climate warming if we continued with the regulations experienced 2020 in all the upcoming years?
        According to the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC) [3] the atmosphere can absorb
        roughly 1042 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> from the beginning of 2021 on until the global temperature will be
        2°C more than pre industrial levels. The two vertical, dashed lines are showing in which year the remaining CO<sub>2</sub> budget will
        be depleted, with and without continuing regulations.
      </p>
      <h5>When will the CO<sub>2</sub> Budget be Depleted?</h5>
      <p>
        According to the prognosis from [2] and given the budget calculations from [3], we <strong>will exceed the 2° C goal in {{ budgetDepletionYearWithoutRestrictions }}</strong>.
        <br>When factoring in the reduction in emissions that the lockdown has entailed, by our calculations
        <strong>we will exceed 2° C of global warming by {{ budgetDepletionYearWithRestrictions }}</strong>.
