      <h1> CO<sub>2</sub>-Emissions </h1>
      <h2> 2019 & 2020 </h2>
      <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the world looked a little bit different in 2020. People stayed at home,
        travelling was often impossible and planes had to stay grounded for the most part.</p>
      <p>These factors have resulted in noticeable changes to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. As can be seen in the chart
        on the right, the daily CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for 2020 look fairly different from those of last year.</p>

      <p>The unit of the y-Axis of the graph is <i>Megatons of carbon dioxide per day</i>. One Megaton equals <strong>1,000,000

      <h2>Difference between 2019 and 2020</h2>
      <p>Let's take a look at how the emissions changed from 2019 to 2020.</p>
      <p>The green areas mark where the emissions were lower in 2020 and red areas mark where they were higher.</p>
      <ul class="legend">
        <li class="area-below">
          <div class="bullet"></div>
          Less Emissions than 2019
        </li>
        <li class="area-above">
          <div class="bullet"></div>
          More Emissions than 2019

      <p>You might wonder which sectors were responsible for these emissions. Take a look at the sectors here:</p>

      <h2>Achieving the climate goals</h2>
      <p>We have seen that the Corona pandemic ensured that significantly less CO<sub>2</sub> was emitted worldwide.
        However, the question remains, what good it has done to our climate. In the foreseeable future, the regulations
        will be loosened, and eventually lifted altogether. But what if - as of today - we would simply continue with
        the containment measures? Could these measures also be used to help us meet our climate goals?
        We set up two prognosis lines, that give insight into just that:
      </p>
      <ul class="legend">
        <li class="linePrognosisLockdown">
          <div class="bullet"></div>
          Continuation with regulations
        </li>
        <li class="linePrognosisNoLockdown">
          <div class="bullet"></div>
          Continuation without regulations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The y-axis depicts the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per day, while the x-axis shows the years.
        The white graph represents the global CO<sub>2</sub> of an average day from 1750 to 2020. From there, our prognosis graphs begin.
        The data for the prognosis for continuing without regulations, comes from the source [1]. Since originally a higher CO<sub>2</sub>
        emission number for 2020 than the actual one was expected, this forecast line starts at that higher value. Based on this data, we
        calculated a forecast for continuing without regulations by mapping this years percentage decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to
        the data from [1].
